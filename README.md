# Welcome

**Mautic** is an open-source marketing automation platform empowering organizations to build meaningful connections with their audiences through data-driven engagement.

This organization is home to projects, documentation, and initiatives that help maintain, extend, and improve Mautic for everyone.

Our shared goal is to make marketing automation **open, accessible, and community-driven** — where anyone can contribute ideas, code, or creativity to help Mautic grow.



## Our Mission & Identity

We believe in a world where marketing technology is:

- **Open:** free to use, study, and improve, without unnecessary vendor constraints.  
- **Collaborative:** built by a diverse global community of marketers, developers, and users.  
- **Privacy-focused & data sovereign:** you keep control (your own database, your infrastructure).



## Brief History & Governance

Mautic was founded in **2014** by **David Hurley**.  
Over time, it evolved into a **community-led open-source project**.

- Mautic’s finances and sponsorships are handled transparently via **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mautic)**.  
- A **Community Council** and teams help with governance, strategy, and operations.  
- Learn more about governance at [mautic.org/governance](https://mautic.org/governance).



## What We Do

Mautic brings together developers, marketers, documentation writers, designers, and contributors to:

- **Maintain the Mautic Core:** the main open-source application ([mautic/mautic](https://github.com/mautic/mautic))  
- **Develop Plugins & Integrations:** extend to CRMs, CMSs, email services, and more  
- **Support Learning & Documentation:** help new users, maintain guides, improve clarity  
- **Foster Community & Events:** run forums, conferences (e.g., Mautic World), and meetups  
- **Promote Open Marketing Standards & Privacy:** champion principles of data sovereignty and user privacy
